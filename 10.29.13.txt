Regular Expressions
list($Username, $Domain) = explode("@",$Email); // explode takes the data and
stores it into an array

list pulls apart the array into individual elements

An MX record tells senders how to send email for your domain.

When your domain is registered, it’s assigned several DNS records, which
enable it to be located on the Internet. These include MX records, which
direct the domain’s mail flow. Each MX record points to an email server that’s
configured to process mail for that domain. There’s typically one record that
points to a primary server, then additional records that point to one or more
backup servers. For users to send and receive email, their domain's MX records
must point to a server that can process their mail.

To filter email through the message security service, you must insert new
records that point to the message security service's servers.
